# 🚀 Getting Started Guide

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

1. **Visit [EDA Playground](https://www.edaplayground.com)**
2. **Select "Icarus Verilog"** as simulator
3. **Copy/paste** from `examples/eda_playground_demo.v`
4. **Click Run** and watch quantum discovery happen!

## What You'll See

- Quantum screening of 6 MOF-74 metal variants
- Breakthrough detection for high-performance catalysts
- Impact assessment for electric aviation
- Multiple catalyst discoveries with scores

## File Structure

- `src/` - Complete quantum chemistry engine
- `examples/` - Ready-to-run demos  
- `docs/` - Technical documentation
- `tests/` - Verification test suites

## Next Steps

1. Run the EDA Playground demo
2. Read technical details in `TECHNICAL_DETAILS.md`
3. Modify catalyst screening parameters
4. Add your own material structures
